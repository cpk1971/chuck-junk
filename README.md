Some ill-considered projects in the ChucK programming language.

# What the hell is ChucK?

Read about ChucK here:
http://chuck.stanford.edu

Get it here:
http://chuck.stanford.edu/release/

Or, alternatively, do the following after installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

`brew install chuck`

# What do you have?

So far, just:

* A rudimentary sampler/tempo combination which acts as a cheezy sequencer.  Run it from the root directory with `chuck Clock Sampler demo/Amen`

# Any gotchas?

I am using version 1.3.5.2 of ChucK
